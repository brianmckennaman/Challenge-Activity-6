# Challenge-Activity-6

The purpose of this activity was to create an app that allows the user to look up the weather by entering the name of a city, and then generating a current day forecast, as well as a 5 day forecast.

First, I created the page and styled it using the Bootstrap framework.

Unfortunately, I was unable to fully implement the JavaScript functionality of fetching the weather data with an API call and generating it on the page, as well as storing and retrieving the user's previous searches in local storage.

A link to the deployed application can be found here: https://brianmckennaman.github.io/Challenge-Assignment-6/
